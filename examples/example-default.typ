#theorem(name: [BÃ©zout])[
  Let $a,b$ be integers, and $d = gcd(a,b)$ be their greatest common divisor.
  Then 
  $ {x a + y b: x, y in ZZ} = d ZZ, $
  where $ZZ$ is the set of integers.

Note the gap before and after a theorem. This can be set by 
```typst
#show: dingli-rules.with(
  upper: 2em,
  lower: 2em, // this is the default value, you can adjust it yourself
)
```
We can refer to a theorem by @thm-in-sec-2. Other types are also OK, see @cor-label.
